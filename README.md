# BayesianML

This is a GitHub repository for Python notebooks that accompany our Bayeisan Machine Learning textbook.  All examples and figures that involved programming have an associated Python notebook that is provided here, and also in cluded in the appendix in the PDF file for the book.  These materials were written for the UVA Bayeisan Machine Learning course.  The prerequisites are some knowledge of Python programming, a course in probability/statistics including linear and logistic regression, and some knowledge of machine learning will be helpful in some topics.  However, a reasonable effort is made in the text to provide background/review concepts.
